Just copy the index.php and "root-styler" folder, into your webserver root folder.
for example if you are using XAMPP, you should copy the files and paste into C:\xampp\htdocs.
As you can see, RootStyler can show the files and folders separately.
### Config.php file
If you look at "root-styler" folder, you see a config.php file, that includes some configurations:
- showScriptFolder:

if you want to hide the script folder (root-styler) you may use this option.

- showPageTitle:

if you want to hide the header of the page, you may set it to false.
